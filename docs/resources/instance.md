# kowabunga_instance (Resource)

Manages a raw virtual machine instance resource. Usage of instance resource requires preliminary creation of network adapters and storage volumes to be associated with the instance. It comes handy when one wants to deploy a specifically tuned virtual machine's configuration. For common usage, it is recommended to use the **kce** resource instead, which provides a standard ready-to-be-used virtual machine, offloading much of the complexity.
